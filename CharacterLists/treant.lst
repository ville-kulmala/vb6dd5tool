Animate Tress (1/day)	The treant magically animates one or two trees it can see within 60 feet of it. These trees have the same statistics as a treant, except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and they only have the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the treant.\n;The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree: or until the treant takes a bonus action to turn  it back into an ainamiate tree. The tree then takes root if possible.
