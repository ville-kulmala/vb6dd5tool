Regeneration 20	The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.
Vampire Weaknesses	The vampire has the following flaws:\n;*Forbiddance.* The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.\n;*Harmed by Running Water.* The vampire takes 20 acid damage when it ends its turn in running water.\n;*Stake to the Heart. *The vampire is destroyed if a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into its heart while it is incapacitated in its resting place.\n;*Sunlight Hypersensitivity.* The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
Legendary Resistance (3/day)	If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to success instead.
Multiattack 2	Vampire form only. The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.
Misty Escape	When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in Shapechange trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.\n;While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach it's resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.
Spider Climb	The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
Charm	(Action) The vampire targets one jumanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is willing target for the vampire's bite attack.\n;Each time the vampire or the vampire's companion do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until vampire is destroyed, is on different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.
